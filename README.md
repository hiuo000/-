Лабораторная работа 4

There are 2 parts of work in files named Lab1-Part1 and Lab1-Part2 respectively. Both parts represent work with collections of training and test data. 
Part 1 represent recognition of basic math functions with illustrations of neural net vision of the functions for training.
Part 2 represent recognition of simple images for making following work.
Data usage represented at https://keras.io/datasets/ and depends on variant.


There are represented such hyperparameters as 
•	Layer count
•	Neurons count per layer (actually it’s not hyperparameter but structure parameter)
•	Learn rate
•	Regularization L1 and L2
•	Output layer activation type
•	Layer activation type 
•	Loss function type
•	Epoch count
